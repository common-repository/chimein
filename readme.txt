Add Conversation to Your Site. ChimeIn adds a dialog layer to your page without interfering with your content. 

== Description ==

Brand-hosted forums FACILITATES communication all the way across the customer life cycle. A website with visitor feedback is much more trusted than one without it. ChimeIn adds a dialog layer to your page without interfering with your content. 

Fetaures:
- simplest to add to site
- as a separate layer, you have no legal liability on user generated content
- ChimeIn does basic moderation of reported posts 
- ChimeIn user notifications create a social hook that makes your visitors return

As a free user, you will get limited moderation rights. By subscribing for ChimeIn you will get:
- highlighted posts
- you can highlight the most constructive visitor posts
- insights and analytics on visitor behavior, content and sentiment

Don't take the dialog to social media. It's three times more likely that someone interested in you or your brand goes to your website, not your Facebook page. Don't send them away, let them converse on your site.
